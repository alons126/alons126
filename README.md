### SuSA Electron-Mode Validation (GENIE)
**Bug identification and fix in a production neutrino–nucleus interaction generator**

- Identified a bug where GENIE (v3.2) generated only 1n1p final states for 2p2h SuSA-MEC
- Traced the issue to missing/misused hadronic tensor tables and incorrect pair selection logic
- Integrated new tensor tables, fixed probability calculations, and restored 2p / 2n final states
- Corrections merged into the official GENIE codebase (v3.4+)

**PR:** https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Generator/pull/242  
Detailed validation in MSc thesis, Section 9.1.3
